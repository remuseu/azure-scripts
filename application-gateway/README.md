# List all expiring soon certificates in Azure Application Gateway

Did you ever had developers or engineers coming to your desk in panic realizing their Azure Application Gateway' certificates expired without them knowing it in advance. Causing them downtime in their release pipeline, dev or worst, their production environment!

## Requirements
Tested with Azure PowerShell Az v1.x.x

Tested with Azure PowerShell Az.ResourceGraph module v0.10.0

## The problematic
Did you ever had developers or engineers coming to your desk in panic realizing their Azure Application Gateway' certificates expired without them knowing it in advance. Causing them downtime in their release pipeline, dev or worst, their production environment!

## What is proposed
Be proactive instead of reactive with this little script. Using this, you can get the list the certificates in your Azure Application Gateway that are soon due to expire. You have full control over the desired time period to be considered as expiring soon.

It is build so that you can take the output and do whatever you want with it after, whenever it's convert it to JSON, CSV, XML.

## Overview
This is an overview of the usage you can do of the script Get-AzureAppGatewayExpiringCertificates

```powershell
Connect-AzAccount  
  
# Will list certificates if they expires 120 days from today   
$audit = .\Get-AzureAppGatewayExpiringCertificates.ps1 -ExpiresInDay 180 -Verbose 
 
$audit
